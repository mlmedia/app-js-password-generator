# JavaScript Password Generator

This one-page application is a simple password generator which uses (vanilla) JavaScript to generate a random password with alpha-numeric characters, numbers, and special characters based on the options passed from the form.  

The Password Generator can be seen here: https://www.dockstreetmedia.com/demo/password-generator/index.html.

## Learn / Adopt / Fork
All of the code is in the single `index.html` file.   You can easily `View Source` to view all of the code in order to learn more about it.  I try to use clear commenting to explain the code.

Also, feel free to adopt and adapt to make it your own.  If you like, fork it and send over a pull request.  Add or solve existing issues.  It is open-source, after all.
